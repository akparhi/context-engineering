### Opening a PR

Invoked at the end of every other playbook. Use the `arcane:pr` skill to write the PR description and to create or update the PR.

**Worktree.** Work from a git worktree off main. Subagents inherit it. Multiple `Agent` calls on the same branch each get their own worktree, or `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/<branch>` between them. Dirty branch with unrelated work: patch out, fresh worktree, apply. Snarled worktree: reset from main, redo minimally. Before you commit, merge, or deploy from a worktree, list the live agents and stop every one that holds it, including grandchildren you never launched. A delegate's children do not inherit its brief, so a read-only instruction never reaches them. Confirm each stop, then run `git status` and read the tree you are about to ship.

**Commits.** Commit liberally. Rebase into small, ordered commits before opening PRs. Each commit is a future PR: landable, ordered to tell the story. Amend when the fix belongs in a just-made commit. New commit when separable.

**PRs.** Run `/deslop` over the diff before commit. Run `/no-comments` before review. Write every PR title and commit body with `/technical-writing`, then apply `/unslop`. Apply every technical-writing layer except Diátaxis. Use one word for each action, keep articles, and avoid `-ing` when a plain verb works.

**Title & Descriptions.** Use the `arcane:pr` skill. On top of it:

- In Evidence, name each real run path and its outcome. For a performance change, report one primary number with its unit in `before → after` form. Link the arena or swarm directory for the remaining evidence. Do not include sample-size methodology, swarm recitals, or metric tables.

Attach videos or screenshots when they prove a claim. Do not paste full SHAs, swarm or arena lane recitals, lever-correction essays, file-by-file checklists, or "CLEAN" verdicts. Put these details in a linked artifact. Do not use `## Summary` or `## Test plan` boilerplate. A commit body does not restate its subject.

**Forge.** Resolve the forge before the first PR operation and keep that choice for create, edit, view, watch, and merge. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the default. If `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, prefer `origin pr ...`. If Origin is absent or cannot resolve the repository, stay on `gh` and record the fallback. Do not require Graphite (`gt`).

**Size and stacks.** Prefer five narrow PRs to one large PR. A stack is a base-branch chain. The root PR targets trunk. Each child branch rebases onto its parent's exact tip and its PR targets the parent branch. Create a child with `origin pr create --status open --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <parent-branch>` according to the resolved forge. Retarget an existing child with `origin pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>`. Branch from trunk only for independent work. Rebase on trunk before substantial stack work.

**Readiness.** Open every PR ready, never as a draft. With Origin, pass `--status open`. With `gh`, omit `--draft`. Some PR tools default to draft, so check every creation call. If a PR still opens as a draft, run `origin pr ready <number>` or `gh pr ready <number>` according to the resolved forge. Run `origin pr view <number>` or `gh pr view <number>` before you refer to PR status.

**Babysit.** Opening a PR does not start a babysit. Post the URL and keep building. Finish the phase or stack first. Run a separate babysit pass only when the user asks for one after the whole stack exists, per `babysit.md`. A babysit for each new PR stalls the build and spends checks on commits that later waves restart. Push back when feedback drifts from intent.

A subagent that opens a PR runs `interrogate`, `/deslop`, and `/no-comments`, and posts the URL. Then it returns to the parent without babysitting, unless it is an Autopilot-full or Autopilot-stack owner. That owner's brief assigns the babysit loop and is the ask `playbooks/babysit.md` waits for. The owner starts the loop after its code-ready report and reports merge-ready or STACK-READY as its playbook says. The rules here and in `playbooks/babysit.md` that hold babysitting until a whole stack is built do not apply to that owner.
